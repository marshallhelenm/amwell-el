#Technical Assessment for El Marshall at Amwell

I made this app very modular even though it's an incredibly simple one. I prefer to do things that way from the start, so that I can expand more easily later!

When analyzing the provided text file, I made the assumption that entries such as "Three Thousand" were to be dismissed along with those like "Floop". Seems to me a more complex program would be needed to convert those too, though it's doable I'm sure.
