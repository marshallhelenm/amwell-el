# Technical Assessment for El Marshall at Amwell

I made this app very modular even though it's an incredibly simple one. I prefer to do things that way from the start, so that I can expand more easily later!

When analyzing the provided text file, I made the assumption that entries such as "Three Thousand" were to be dismissed along with those like "Floop". Seems to me a more complex program would be needed to convert those too, though it's doable I'm sure.

I was overthinking things in the beginning - thanks for the tip to just use Node! Helped jog me out of a mental rut. This was fun once I got going with it!

To run simply run app.js in the terminal, and it will log the results.
